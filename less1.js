// To get into the rhythm, let's do a simple hello world.

// Write a Node program that accepts two command-line arguments, X and
// Y and prints out to the console the following text:

//   ALL YOUR X ARE BELONG TO Y

// When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
// environment with:

//   levelmeup run program.js

// And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

//   levelmeup verify program.js

// And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
// a correct solution, run `levelmeup` again and select the next problem!

var X = process.argv[2],
	Y = process.argv[3];

console.log('ALL YOUR ' + X + ' ARE BELONG TO ' + Y);
